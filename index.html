    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>

    <p>My name is Vo Ngoc Bao Nghi and I am currently taking Diploma: Computer Studies at Langara College. I have been in Vancouver for 4 years and I really enjoy living here.</p>
    <p>I never thought I would study information technology. Before, when I was in high school, I was very bad at computer science, so I thought I was not suitable for this major. However, when I entered college, I saw the potential of technology, especially during the covid pandemic. Therefore, I decided to apply for this major. So far, I really enjoy coding and creating websites.</p>
